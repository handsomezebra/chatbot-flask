# Build your own ChatGPT app

This repository includes a simple Python Flask app that streams responses from ChatGPT
to an HTML/JS frontend using [NDJSON](http://ndjson.org/) over a [ReadableStream](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream).

The repository is designed for use with [Docker containers](https://www.docker.com/), both for local development and deployment. üê≥

## Local development

In addition to the `Dockerfile` that's used in production, this repo includes a `docker-compose.yaml` for
local development which creates a volume for the app code. That allows you to make changes to the code
and see them instantly.

1. Install [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/). If you opened this inside Github Codespaces or a Dev Container in VS Code, installation is not needed. ‚ö†Ô∏è If you're on an Apple M1/M2, you won't be able to run `docker` commands inside a Dev Container; either use Codespaces or do not open the Dev Container.

2. Make sure that the `.env` file exists. 

3. Start the services with this command:

    ```shell
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

4. Click 'http://0.0.0.0:50505' in the terminal, which should open a new tab in the browser. You may need to navigate to 'http://localhost:50505' if that URL doesn't work.
